"Below are the electrical safety tests commonly available on medical equipment safety "

+ " testing and even routine testing protocols. Protocols based on both sets of guidance are also"
+ " available on many medical equipment safety testers.<p>"
+ "NORMAL CONDITIONS AND SINGLE FAULT CONDITIONS.<br>"
+ " A basic principle behind the philosophy of electrical safety is that in the"
+ " event of a single abnormal external condition arising or of the failure of a single means"
+ " of protection against a hazard, no safety hazard should arise. Such conditions are called"
+ "single fault conditions (SFCs) and include such situations as the interruption of the"
+ " protective earth conductor or of one supply conductor, the appearance of an external voltage"
+ " on an applied part, the failure of basic insulation or of temperature limiting devices."
+ "<p>Where a"
+ " single fault condition is not applied, the equipment is said to be in 'normal condition' (NC)."
+ " However, it is important to understand that even in this condition, the performance of certain"
+ " tests may compromise the means of protection against electric shock. For example, if earth"
+ " leakage current is measured in normal condition, the impedance of the measuring device in series"
+ " with the protective earth conductor means that there is no effective supplementary protection"
+ " against electric shock.</p>Many electrical safety tests are carried out under various single "
+ "fault conditions in order to verify that there is no hazard even should these conditions occur"
+ " in practice.<p> It is often the case that single fault conditions represent the worst case and"
+ " will give the most adverse results. Clearly the safety of the equipment under test may be"
+ " compromised when such tests are performed. Personnel carrying out electrical safety tests "
+ "should be aware that the normal means for protection against electric shock are not necessarily"
+ " operative during testing and should therefore exercise due precautions for their own safety and"
